0.	COMPILER / ENVIRONMENT ASSUMPTIONS

Do not use include guards.
	#ifndef _MY_CLASS_H
	#define _MY_CLASS_H
	// ...
	#endif // !_MY_CLASS_H

	Should be...
	
	#pragma once
	// ...

Every file must have a trailing newline

We can assume the only platforms are:
	Win32 (x86) where XS_ARCH_WIDTH is 32
	Win64 (x86_64) where XS_ARCH_WIDTH is 64
	Linux32 (i386) where XS_ARCH_WIDTH is 32
	Linux64 (x86_64) where XS_ARCH_WIDTH is 64

Windows has a premade MSVC 2010 project.
Other platforms have a SCons project, which is only guaranteed to work on Linux (32 and 64)



1. SPACING / INDENTATION / LINE WRAPPING

Use tabs with a width of 4
Never indent with spaces

Opening braces belong on the same line as the statement/definition, including functions and conditional expressions
	void Function( void ) {
	}
	if ( x ) {
	}
	switch ( x ) {
	}

Pad parenthesised expressions as such...
	for ( i=0; i<3; i++ ) {
		if ( x )
			Func( y );
	}

For multi-line if/else statements, the else keyword starts a new line
	if ( x ) {
		// ...
	}
	else { // <---
		// ...
	}

Some projects wrap lines at 80 columns. This was due to UNIX terminals only supporting 80 columns.
It is now common to see 24-27 inch monitors, but long statements/comments are easier to read if they are wrapped
	Wrap statements at *roughly* 80 columns
	Wrap comments at roughly 100 columns



2. COMMENTS

Do not over-comment code. This includes being exceedingly explicit and comment style.
	// ================
	// GetClientIDForName
	// Returns: integer of the client's ID for the specified name,
	//			or -1 if client is not found
	// ================
	int GetClientIDForName( const char *name ) {
		// ...
	}

	Could simply be...

	// returns -1 if client does not exist
	int GetClientIDForName( const char *name ) {
		// ...
	}

Recursive functions should be explicitly commented at both the point of recursion, and above the function definition

Line comments should have a space at the start
	// good
	//bad

Line comments that span multiple lines should be indented with tab for carry-on sentences
	// line 1 starts here and
	//	continues on here after wrapping
	// line 2 starts here



3.	NAMING

Functions start with upper case. All consecutive words start with upper case.
	void SomeFunction( void );
	void Some_Function( void ); // BAD
	void someFunction( void ); // BAD
	void Somefunction( void ); // BAD

Variables start with lower case. All consecutive words start with lower case.
	int someInteger;
	int some_integer; // BAD
	int someinteger; // BAD
	int SomeInteger; // BAD

Classes and object-structs* should start with upper case, with some exceptions for common types.
An object-struct is a struct which is treated as an object, not a POD type
Object-structs shall only be used for the case where data encapsulation is not a goal, as default exposure is public.
	class Font {}; // object, has font->Draw() method
	struct RenderCommand {}; // object-struct, has cmd->Execute() method
	struct commandContext_t {}; // POD type
	struct vector3 {}; // object-struct, but is a common type. exception to the rule.

Enums and structs that are not treated as objects (i.e. POD type) shall follow the next rule...

All non-primitive-esque types start with lower case and use the _t suffix to indicate a type
	typedef float real; // primitive-esque, so this is fine
	struct gameEntity_t {};
	enum flags_t {};
	typedef uint32_t fileHandle_t;

Enumerated constants are all upper case. All consecutive words are separated by an underscore.
Constants should generally use a shorthand prefix to avoid name clashing, e.g. IF_RGBA16F for internal texture formats
Only the first constant may be assigned a value, enumeration will handle the rest.
The last constant may be used to know the maximum amount of legitimate values

	enum myEnum_t {
		ENUM_ONE=0,
		ENUM_TWO,
		ENUM_THREE,
		ENUM_MAX
	};

Preprocessor definitions are all upper case. All consecutive words are separated by an underscore.
This includes literals, macros, conditional compiling
	#define DLL_EXT ".dll" // literals
	#define ARRAY_LEN( x ) (sizeof( (x) ) / sizeof( (*x) )) // macros
	#define XS_LITTLE_ENDIAN // conditional compiling

Preprocessor definitions shall be wrapped in parenthesis to enforce order of operations
This includes all preprocessor definitions, not just those involving arithmetic
	#define SOME_VALUE 32 + 32
	int otherValue = 16 * SOME_VALUE; // (16*32) + 32

	Should be...

	#define SOME_VALUE (32 + 32)
	int otherValue = 16 * SOME_VALUE; // 16 * (32 + 32)



4. SCOPING / NAMESPACE

Never use 'using namespace xxx'
This includes 'using namespace std' and 'using namespace XS'

All engine code shall be encapsulated in the XS namespace, followed by the module namespace (e.g. XS::File::Read())

Namespaces begin with upper case



5. C->C++: CLASSES / ITERATORS

Classes should avoid unnecessary one-line Get/Set methods.
Get/Set shall only be used when there are side-effects such as announcing Cvar changes, updating a cache, etc

	class X {
	private:
		int x;
		// ...
	public:
		void SetX( int newX ) {
			x = newX;
		}
		int GetX( void ) {
			return x;
		}
	};

	Or...

	class X {
	public:
		int x;
		// ...
	};
	X.x = 10;

Iterators should always be named 'it' except for when they would alias another iterator in that scope

Always use prefix increment operator on iterators for performance reasons
	for ( /* ... */; ++it ) {}

Use the 'auto' keyword when dealing with iterators
	for ( auto it = x.begin(); it != x.end(); ++it ) {}



6. TYPES

Always consider 64 bit types when dealing with pointers, sizes, bit values, unsigned/signed comparisons
	size_t bufferLen = sizeof( buffer );
	ptrdiff_t d = p1-p2;
	#define CONTENTS_LAVA (0x0040u)
	uint32_t mask = CONTENTS_ENVIRONMENT & ~(CONTENTS_LAVA);
	someInt = (int)"literal"; // can NOT store 64 bit pointers in 32 bit integers

Do not typedef structs
	typedef struct myStruct_s {} myStruct_t; // bad
	struct myStruct_t {}; // good

Avoid using enums for bit-values *in general* in favour of preprocessor definitions
	if ( bits & (1<<ENUM_ONE) ) { // BAD, in most cases.
	if ( bits & (1<<WP_ROCKET) ) { // acceptable, as WP_ is a list of weapons and not necessarily used for bit values
	if ( bits & BIT_ONE ) { // good, if #define BIT_ONE (0x0001u)

Use const as much as possible.

USE CONST AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE!

Do NOT cast away constness.

Function parameters dealing with const pointers shall indicate what is being read, and what is being written
	static void GetPath( const char *gamePath, char *outPath, size_t outLen );

Use const as much as possible.



7. LITERALS

Always use precision specifier when dealing with floating point numbers
	float f = 0.6f; // good
	float f = 1.0; // BAD!
	float f = 1.f; // BAD!

Use sign specifier when defining literals to be used for bit values and such
	#define MASK_ALL (0xFFFFFFFFU)

	uint32_t Function( void ) {
		// ...
		return 0U;
	}



8.	FILE NAMES

File names should follow this convention...

	XSRenderer/XSRenderCommand.h
	XSRenderer/XSRenderCommand.cpp

	namespace XS {
		namespace Renderer {
			class RenderCommand {
			};
		}
	}
